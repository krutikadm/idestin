            The Bahamas (/bəˈhɑːməz/ (About this soundlisten)), known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas,[12]
            is
            a country within the Lucayan Archipelago of the West Indies in the Atlantic. It takes up 97% of the Lucayan
            Archipelago's land area and is home to 88% of the archipelago's population. The archipelagic state consists
            of
            more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean, and is located north of Cuba and northwest of
            the
            island of Hispaniola (split between Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and the Turks and Caicos Islands,
            southeast of the US state of Florida, and east of the Florida Keys. The capital is Nassau on the island of
            New
            Providence. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes The Bahamas' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2
            (180,000 sq mi) of ocean space.

        <h3>Climates in Bahamas</h3>
    </div>
    <div>\
        According to the Köppen climate classification, the climate of The Bahamas is mostly tropical savannah climate
        or Aw, with a hot and wet season and a warm and dry season. The low latitude, warm tropical Gulf Stream, and low
        elevation give The Bahamas a warm and winterless climate.[73]

        As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. There is
        only a 7 °C (13 °F) difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. Every
        few decades low temperatures can fall below 10 °C (50 °F) for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes down
        from the North American mainland, however there has never been a frost or freeze recorded in the Bahamian
        Islands. Only once in recorded history has snow been seen in the air anywhere in The Bahamas, this occurred in
        Freeport on 19 January 1977, when snow mixed with rain was seen in the air for a short time.[74] The Bahamas are
        often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days of sunlight
        annually. Much of the natural vegetation is tropical scrub and cactus and succulents are common in
        landscapes.[75]

        Tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally impact The Bahamas. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew passed over the
        northern portions of the islands, and Hurricane Floyd passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999.
        Hurricane Dorian of 2019 passed over the archipelago at destructive Category 5 strength with sustained winds of
        298 km/h (185 mph) and wind gusts up to 350 km/h (220 mph), becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record to
        impact the northwestern islands of Grand Bahama and Great Abaco.[76]

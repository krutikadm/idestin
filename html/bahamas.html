                The Bahamas (/bəˈhɑːməz/ (About this soundlisten)), known officially as the Commonwealth of The
                Bahamas,[12]
                is
                a country within the Lucayan Archipelago of the West Indies in the Atlantic. It takes up 97% of the
                Lucayan
                Archipelago's land area and is home to 88% of the archipelago's population. The archipelagic state
                consists
                of
                more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean, and is located north of Cuba and
                northwest of
                the
                island of Hispaniola (split between Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and the Turks and Caicos Islands,
                southeast of the US state of Florida, and east of the Florida Keys. The capital is Nassau on the island
                of
                New
                Providence. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes The Bahamas' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2
                (180,000 sq mi) of ocean space.

            <h3 class="intro">Climates in Bahamas</h3>

            <div class="about">
                According to the Köppen climate classification, the climate of The Bahamas is mostly tropical savannah
                climate
                or Aw, with a hot and wet season and a warm and dry season. The low latitude, warm tropical Gulf Stream,
                and
                low
                elevation give The Bahamas a warm and winterless climate.[73]

                As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season.
                There
                is
                only a 7 °C (13 °F) difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama
                islands.
                Every
                few decades low temperatures can fall below 10 °C (50 °F) for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak
                comes
                down
                from the North American mainland, however there has never been a frost or freeze recorded in the
                Bahamian
                Islands. Only once in recorded history has snow been seen in the air anywhere in The Bahamas, this
                occurred
                in
                Freeport on 19 January 1977, when snow mixed with rain was seen in the air for a short time.[74] The
                Bahamas
                are
                often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days of sunlight
                annually. Much of the natural vegetation is tropical scrub and cactus and succulents are common in
                landscapes.[75]

                Tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally impact The Bahamas. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew passed over
                the
                northern portions of the islands, and Hurricane Floyd passed near the eastern portions of the islands in
                1999.
                Hurricane Dorian of 2019 passed over the archipelago at destructive Category 5 strength with sustained
                winds
                of
                298 km/h (185 mph) and wind gusts up to 350 km/h (220 mph), becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on
                record to
                impact the northwestern islands of Grand Bahama and Great Abaco.[76]
